My dotfiles for ubuntu, this setup will install everything I use on Ubuntu 14.04. You can also use, since it is setup installs really useful things. See below what it installs, I'll be happy if it is useful for you.

## Dependencies

For install `adobe-flashplayer` you need follow these steps:

1. Open `Software and Updates` in `System Settings`  and set Canonical Partners in Other Software.
2. Do nothing, the dotfiles will install for you :)

## How to install?

Download via `wget`:

```sh
$ wget https://github.com/randsonjs/dotfiles/archive/master.zip
```

We need the unzip file, following these commands: 

```sh
$ [sudo] unzip master.zip
```

The `unzip`command will create a `dotfiles-master` folder, we need enter in this directory:

```sh
$ cd dotfiles-master
```

And finnaly run: 

```sh
$ ./dotfiles
```

The dotfiles will ask your password a first time. And also confirm the installation of packages. For now, enjoy the codes in your terminal :)
